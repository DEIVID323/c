                        &emsp; Para empezar si me quieres porque le diste clic al corazon jejeðŸ˜˜ <br><br>
                        &emsp; Cielo, espero que estÃ©s bien. Segundo, no sÃ© cÃ³mo empezar esto, jeje, pero Â¿sabes algo? Me gustas bastante y quiero decirte que gracias por los momentos que hemos compartido. Recuerdo el dÃ­a que me hablaste para hacer un trabajo en pareja; no pensÃ© que pasarÃ­amos de hacer un trabajo en pareja a ser pareja, jaja no mentiras. Pero sÃ­ recuerdo que ese dia me preguntaste si ya tenÃ­a con quien hacer el trabajo, y pues te dije que no, y desde ese dÃ­a empezamos a hablar. Hubo un tiempo que nos dejamos de hablar, pero el punto es que desde el primer dÃ­a fuiste sÃºper amable conmigo y me caÃ­ste sÃºper bien. Gracias por ser tan amable conmigo desde el principio. Por estar ahÃ­ cuando necesitaba algo. Te ganaste mi confianza hasta el punto de que podÃ­a abrirme contigo. Y No sÃ© exactamente en quÃ© momento pasÃ³, pero entre cada conversaciÃ³n, cada gesto bonito que hacÃ­as conmigo, cada vez que me escuchabas o simplemente me apoyabas, ahÃ­ fue donde empezaste a gustarme. Aquel dia me preguntaste que porque me gustabas y porque no otra persona y la respuesta es que me gusta tu forma de ser me gusta que seas tu, como eres conmigo, como me tratas me haces sentir comodo tranquilo y eso lo valoro mucho, me gusta que eres sencilla autentica. Tambien me gusta mucho como te esfuerzas por salir adelante  admiro eso, cÃ³mo le metes ganas a lo que estamos estudiando, aunque estÃ©s
                        cansada con sueÃ±o que eso es normal en ti jeje, Igual sigues ahi sin rendirte, y eso para mÃ­ vale un montÃ³n. Y no sÃ© eso me gusta mucho de ti, me parece muy bonito hasta me motiva. Y en lo fisico me enacanta tu carita, me gusta cuando me quedas mirando y te digo que porque me miras asi jeje, me gusta

                        &emsp;  So, here it isâ€¦ I like you, a lot. Maybe even love. Would you be my Valentine? No matter your answer, I just wanted you to know how special you are to me. Youâ€™ve filled my heart with warmth in ways I never expected, and for that, Iâ€™m grateful. But if you say yes, I promise to make every day feel like Valentineâ€™s Day for youâ€”to cherish you, to make you smile, and to remind you just how much you mean to me.
